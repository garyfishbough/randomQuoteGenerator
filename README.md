# randomQuoteGenerator
Generates a random quote

  The Random Quote Generator recalls quotes from an array and displays them to the page.  All the quotes contain a source and tag(such as humor, politics...) some quotes
  also display a citation and the year the quote was made.
  
  The site will automatically change the quote every 10 seconds unless the button is clicked sooner, the background will also randomly change its color each time the
  quote changes.
